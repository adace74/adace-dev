Hack #1(works on things like git):

  CFLAGS      C compiler flags
  LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
              nonstandard directory <lib dir>

NOTE: If necessary, set these to -I/usr/local/include and -L/usr/local/lib
BEFORE running configure.  Seems to work for git.

Hack #2(works on PHP):

NOTE: Just don't do "make -j 2".  Just...don't.  Blah.

Compile Using Clang
-------------------

* Ports: This part is somewhat simple.
         Simply "make CC=clang CXX=clang" when compiling from port.

* PHP(and other packages): This part is a little more complex.
                           export CC="clang"
                           Then run configure.

  NOTE: Don't run PHP with "make -j 2", for some reason then it
        won't link properly.
